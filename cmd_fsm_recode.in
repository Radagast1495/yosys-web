    fsm_recode [-encoding type] [-fm_set_fsm_file file] [selection]

This pass reassign the state encodings for FSM cells. At the moment only
one-hot encoding and binary encoding is supported. The option -encoding
can be used to specify the encoding scheme used for FSMs without the
`fsm_encoding' attribute (or with the attribute set to `auto'.

The option -fm_set_fsm_file can be used to generate a file containing the
mapping from old to new FSM encoding in form of Synopsys Formality set_fsm_*
commands.
