<h1>memory - translate memories to basic cells</h1>
<pre>
    memory [-nomap] [selection]

This pass calls all the other memory_* passes in a useful order:

    memory_dff
    memory_collect
    memory_map          (skipped if called with -nomap)

This converts memories to word-wide DFFs and address decoders
or moultiport memory blocks if called with the -nomap option.
