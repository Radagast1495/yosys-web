<h1>tcl - execute a TCL script file</h1>
<pre>
    tcl &lt;filename&gt;

This command executes the tcl commands in the specified file.
Use 'yosys cmd' to run the yosys command 'cmd' from tcl.

The tcl command 'yosys -import' can be used to import all yosys
commands directly as tcl commands to the tcl shell. The yosys
command 'proc' is wrapped using the tcl command 'procs' in order
to avoid a name collision with the tcl builting command 'proc'.
