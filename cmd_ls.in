<h1>ls - list modules or objects in modules</h1>
<pre>
    ls [pattern]

When no active module is selected, this prints a list of all modules.

When an active module is selected, this prints a list of objects in the module.

If a pattern is given, the objects matching the pattern are printed

Note that this command does not use the selection mechanism and always operates
on the whole design or whole active module. Use 'select -list' to show a list
of currently selected objects.
