<h1>hilomap - technology mapping of constant hi- and/or lo-drivers</h1>
<pre>
    hilomap [options] [selection]

Map module inputs/outputs to PAD cells from a library. This pass
can only map to very simple PAD cells. Use 'techmap' to further map
the resulting cells to more sophisticated PAD cells.

    -hicell &lt;celltype&gt; &lt;portname&gt;
        Replace constant hi bits with this cell.

    -locell &lt;celltype&gt; &lt;portname&gt;
        Replace constant lo bits with this cell.

    -singleton
        Create only one hi/lo cell and connect all constant bits
        to that cell. Per default a separate cell is created for
        each constant bit.
