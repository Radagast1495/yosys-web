<h1>techmap - simple technology mapper</h1>
<pre>
    techmap [-map filename] [selection]

This pass implements a very simple technology mapper that replaces cells in
the design with implementations given in form of a verilog or ilang source
file.

    -map filename
        the library of cell implementations to be used.
        without this parameter a builtin library is used that
        transforms the internal RTL cells to the internal gate
        library.

When a module in the map file has the 'celltype' attribute set, it will match
cells with a type that match the text value of this attribute.

When a module in the map file contains a wire with the name 'TECHMAP_FAIL' (or
one matching '*.TECHMAP_FAIL') then no substitution will be performed. The
modules in the map file are tried in alphabetical order.

When a module in the map file has a parameter where the according cell in the
design has a port, the module from the map file is only used if the port in
the design is connected to a constant value. The parameter is then set to the
constant value.

See 'help extract' for a pass that does the opposite thing.

See 'help flatten' for a pass that does flatten the design (which is
esentially techmap but using the design itself as map library).
