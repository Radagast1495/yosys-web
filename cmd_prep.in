<h1>prep - generic synthesis script</h1>
<pre>
    prep [options]

This command runs a conservative RTL synthesis. A typical application for this
is the preparation stage of a verification flow. This command does not operate
on partly selected designs.

    -top &lt;module&gt;
        use the specified module as top module (default='top')

    -nordff
        passed to 'memory_dff'. prohibits merging of FFs into memory read ports

    -run &lt;from_label&gt;[:&lt;to_label&gt;]
        only run the commands between the labels (see below). an empty
        from label is synonymous to 'begin', and empty to label is
        synonymous to the end of the command list.


The following commands are executed by this synthesis command:

    begin:
        hierarchy -check [-top &lt;top&gt;]

    prep:
        proc
        opt_const
        opt_clean
        check
        opt -keepdc
        wreduce
        memory_dff [-nordff]
        opt_clean
        memory_collect
        opt -keepdc -fast

    check:
        stat
        check
