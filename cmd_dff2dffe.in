<h1>dff2dffe - transform $dff cells to $dffe cells</h1>
<pre>
    dff2dffe [selection]

This pass transforms $dff cells driven by a tree of multiplexers with one or
more feedback paths to $dffe cells. It also works on gate-level cells such as
$_DFF_P_, $_DFF_N_ and $_MUX_.

    -unmap
        operate in the opposite direction: replace $dffe cells with combinations
        of $dff and $mux cells. the options below are ignore in unmap mode.

    -direct &lt;internal_gate_type&gt; &lt;external_gate_type&gt;
        map directly to external gate type. &lt;internal_gate_type&gt; can
        be any internal gate-level FF cell (except $_DFFE_??_). the
        &lt;external_gate_type&gt; is the cell type name for a cell with an
        identical interface to the &lt;internal_gate_type&gt;, except it
        also has an high-active enable port 'E'.
          Usually &lt;external_gate_type&gt; is an intemediate cell type
        that is then translated to the final type using 'techmap'.
