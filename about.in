<h1>About</h1>

<p>Yosys is a framework for Verilog RTL synthesis. It currently has
extensive Verilog-2005 support and provides a basic set of
synthesis algorithms for various application domains.</p>

<p>Yosys can be adapted to perform any synthesis job by combining
the existing passes (algorithms) using synthesis scripts and
adding additional passes as needed by extending the yosys C++
code base.</p>

<p>Yosys is free software licensed under the ISC license (a GPL
compatible license that is similar in terms to the MIT license
or the 2-clause BSD license).</p>

<h3>Example Usage</h3>

<p>Yosys is controlled using synthesis scripts. For example, the following
Yosys synthesis script reads a design (with the top module <tt>mytop</tt>) from
the verilog file <tt>mydesign.v</tt>, synthesizes it to a gate-level netlist
using the cell library in the Liberty file <tt>mycells.lib</tt> and writes the
synthesized results as Verilog netlist to <tt>synth.v</tt>:</p>

<pre># read design 
read_verilog mydesign.v
hierarchy -check -top mytop

# the high-level stuff
proc; memory; opt; fsm; opt

# mapping to internal cell library
techmap; opt

# mapping flip-flops to mycells.lib
dfflibmap -liberty mycells.lib

# mapping logic to mycells.lib
abc -liberty mycells.lib

# cleanup
opt

# write synthesized design
write_verilog synth.v</pre>
