<h1>scc - detect strongly connected components (logic loops)</h1>
<pre>
    scc [options] [selection]

This command identifies strongly connected components (aka logic loops) in the
design.

    -max_depth &lt;num&gt;
        limit to loops not longer than the specified number of cells. This can
        e.g. be useful in identifying local loops in a module that turns out
        to be one gigantic SCC.

    -all_cell_types
        Usually this command only considers internal non-memory cells. With
        this option set, all cells are considered. For unkown cells all ports
        are assumed to be bidirectional 'inout' ports.

    -set_attr &lt;name&gt; &lt;value&gt;
    -set_cell_attr &lt;name&gt; &lt;value&gt;
    -set_wire_attr &lt;name&gt; &lt;value&gt;
        set the specified attribute on all cells and/or wires that are part of
        a logic loop. the special token {} in the value is replaced with a
        unique identifier for the logic loop.

    -select
        replace the current selection with a selection of all cells and wires
        that are part of a found logic loop
