<h1>synth - generic synthesis script</h1>
<pre>
    synth [options]

This command runs the default synthesis script. This command does not operate
on partly selected designs.

    -top &lt;module&gt;
        use the specified module as top module (default='top')

    -encfile &lt;file&gt;
        passed to 'fsm_recode' via 'fsm'

    -noabc
        do not run abc (as if yosys was compiled without ABC support)

    -run &lt;from_label&gt;[:&lt;to_label&gt;]
        only run the commands between the labels (see below). an empty
        from label is synonymous to 'begin', and empty to label is
        synonymous to the end of the command list.


The following commands are executed by this synthesis command:

    begin:
        hierarchy -check [-top &lt;top&gt;]

    coarse:
        proc
        opt
        wreduce
        alumacc
        share
        opt
        fsm
        opt -fast
        memory -nomap
        opt_clean

    fine:
        opt -fast -full
        memory_map
        opt -full
        techmap
        opt -fast

    abc:
        abc -fast
        opt -fast
