<h1>rename - rename object in the design</h1>
<pre>
    rename old_name new_name

Rename the specified object. Note that selection patterns are not supported
by this command.


    rename -enumerate [-pattern &lt;pattern&gt;] [selection]

Assign short auto-generated names to all selected wires and cells with private
names. The -pattern option can be used to set the pattern for the new names.
The character % in the pattern is replaced with a integer number. The default
pattern is '_%_'.

    rename -hide [selection]

Assign private names (the ones with $-prefix) to all selected wires and cells
with public names. This ignores all selected ports.
