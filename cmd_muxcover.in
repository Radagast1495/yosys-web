    muxcover [options] [selection]

Cover trees of $_MUX_ cells with $_MUX{4,8,16}_ cells

    -mux4, -mux8, -mux16
        Use the specified types of MUXes. If none of those options are used,
        the effect is the same as if all of them where used.

    -nodecode
        Do not insert decoder logic. This reduces the number of possible
        substitutions, but guarantees that the resulting circuit is not
        less efficient than the original circuit.
