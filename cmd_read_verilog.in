<h1>read_verilog - read modules from verilog file</h1>
<pre>
    read_verilog [filename]

Load modules from a verilog file to the current design. A large subset of
Verilog-2005 is supported.

    -dump_ast1
        dump abstract syntax tree (before simplification)

    -dump_ast2
        dump abstract syntax tree (after simplification)

    -dump_vlog
        dump ast as verilog code (after simplification)

    -yydebug
        enable parser debug output

    -nolatches
        usually latches are synthesized into logic loops
        this option prohibits this and sets the output to 'x'
        in what would be the latches hold condition

        this behavior can also be achieved by setting the
        'nolatches' attribute on the respective module or
        always block.

    -nomem2reg
        under certain conditions memories are converted to registers
        early during simplification to ensure correct handling of
        complex corner cases. this option disables this behavior.

        this can also be achieved by setting the 'nomem2reg'
        attribute on the respective module or register.

    -mem2reg
        always convert memories to registers. this can also be
        achieved by setting the 'mem2reg' attribute on the respective
        module or register.

    -ppdump
        dump verilog code after pre-processor

    -nopp
        do not run the pre-processor

    -lib
        only create empty blackbox modules

    -noopt
        don't perform basic optimizations (such as const folding) in the
        high-level front-end.

    -icells
        interpret cell types starting with '$' as internal cell types

    -ignore_redef
        ignore re-definitions of modules. (the default behavior is to
        create an error message.)

    -defer
        only read the abstract syntax tree and defer actual compilation
        to a later 'hierarchy' command. Useful in cases where the default
        parameters of modules yield invalid or not synthesizable code.

    -setattr &lt;attribute_name&gt;
        set the specified attribute (to the value 1) on all loaded modules

    -Dname[=definition]
        define the preprocessor symbol 'name' and set its optional value
        'definition'

    -Idir
        add 'dir' to the directories which are used when searching include
        files

The command 'verilog_defaults' can be used to register default options for
subsequent calls to 'read_verilog'.

Note that the Verilog frontend does a pretty good job of processing valid
verilog input, but has not very good error reporting. It generally is
recommended to use a simulator (for example icarus verilog) for checking
the syntax of the code, rather than to rely on read_verilog for that.
