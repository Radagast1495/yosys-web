    write_edif [options] [filename]

Write the current design to an EDIF netlist file.

    -top top_module
        set the specified module as design top module

Unfortunately there are different "flavors" of the EDIF file format. This
command generates EDIF files for the Xilinx place&amp;route tools. It might be
necessary to make small modifications to this command when a different tool
is targeted.
