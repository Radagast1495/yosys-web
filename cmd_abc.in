<h1>abc - use ABC for technology mapping</h1>
<pre>
    abc [options] [selection]

This pass uses the ABC tool [1] for technology mapping of yosys's internal gate
library to a target architecture.

    -exe &lt;command&gt;
        use the specified command name instead of "yosys-abc" to execute ABC.
        This can e.g. be used to call a specific version of ABC or a wrapper.

    -script &lt;file&gt;
        use the specified ABC script file instead of the default script.

    -liberty &lt;file&gt;
        generate netlists for the specified cell library (using the liberty
        file format). Without this option, ABC is used to optimize the netlist
        but keeps using yosys's internal gate library. This option is ignored if
        the -script option is also used.

    -constr &lt;file&gt;
        pass this file with timing constraints to ABC

    -lut &lt;width&gt;
        generate netlist using luts of (max) the specified width.

    -nocleanup
        when this option is used, the temporary files created by this pass
        are not removed. this is useful for debugging.

This pass does not operate on modules with unprocessed processes in it.
(I.e. the 'proc' pass should be used first to convert processes to netlists.)
