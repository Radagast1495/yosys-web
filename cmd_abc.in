<h1>abc - use ABC for technology mapping</h1>
<pre>
    abc [options] [selection]

This pass uses the ABC tool [1] for technology mapping of yosys's internal gate
library to a target architecture.

    -exe &lt;command&gt;
        use the specified command name instead of "yosys-abc" to execute ABC.
        This can e.g. be used to call a specific version of ABC or a wrapper.

    -script &lt;file&gt;
        use the specified ABC script file instead of the default script.

        if &lt;file&gt; starts with a plus sign (+), then the rest of the filename
        string is interprated as the command string to be passed to ABC. the
        leading plus sign is removed and all commas (,) in the string are
        replaced with blanks before the string is passed to ABC.

        if no -script parameter is given, the following scripts are used:

        for -liberty without -constr:
          strash; scorr -v; ifraig -v; retime -v; strash; dch -vf; map -v

        for -liberty with -constr:
          strash; scorr -v; ifraig -v; retime -v; strash; dch -vf; map -v;
               buffer -v; upsize -v; dnsize -v; stime -p

        for -lut:
          strash; scorr -v; ifraig -v; retime -v; strash; dch -vf; if -v

        otherwise:
          strash; scorr -v; ifraig -v; retime -v; strash; dch -vf; map -v

    -liberty &lt;file&gt;
        generate netlists for the specified cell library (using the liberty
        file format).

    -constr &lt;file&gt;
        pass this file with timing constraints to ABC. use with -liberty.

        a constr file contains two lines:
            set_driving_cell &lt;cell_name&gt;
            set_load &lt;floating_point_number&gt;

        the set_driving_cell statement defines which cell type is assumed to
        drive the primary inputs and the set_load statement sets the load in
        femtofarads for each primary output.

    -lut &lt;width&gt;
        generate netlist using luts of (max) the specified width.

    -dff
        also pass $_DFF_?_ cells through ABC (only one clock domain, if many
        clock domains are present in a module, the one with the largest number
        of $_DFF_?_ cells in it is used)

    -clk [!]&lt;signal-name&gt;
        use the specified clock domain. (when this option is used in combination
        with -dff, then it falls back to the automatic dection of clock domain
        if the specified clock is not found in a module.)

    -keepff
        set the "keep" attribute on flip-flop output wires. (and thus preserve
        them, for example for equivialence checking.)

    -nocleanup
        when this option is used, the temporary files created by this pass
        are not removed. this is useful for debugging.

When neither -liberty nor -lut is used, the Yosys standard cell library is
loaded into ABC before the ABC script is executed.

This pass does not operate on modules with unprocessed processes in it.
(I.e. the 'proc' pass should be used first to convert processes to netlists.)
