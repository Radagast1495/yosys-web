<h1>freduce - perform functional reduction</h1>
<pre>
    freduce [options] [selection]

This pass performs functional reduction in the circuit. I.e. if two nodes are
equivialent, they are merged to one node and one of the redundant drivers is
unconnected. A subsequent call to 'clean' will remove the redundant drivers.

    -v, -vv
        enable verbose or very verbose output

    -inv
        enable explicit handling of inverted signals

This pass is undef-aware, i.e. it considers don't-care values for detecting
equivialent nodes.

All selected wires are considered for rewiring. The selected cells cover the
circuit that is analyzed.
